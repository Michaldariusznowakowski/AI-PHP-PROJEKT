# Donde-php-project
Repository for student project.
This is a project made entirely in PHP, the goal was to create an interactive map from scratch that allows you to locate university employees.
Features:
searching for an employee by name,
displaying the employee's current activities, which allows you to locate him in a given room,
we created our own MVC from scratch (restrictions imposed by the course instructor did not allow the use of ready-made frameworks such as Laravel)
The entire project is based on a database, it does not have any permanently entered elements, this way you can add a new building, new floor, new rooms.

We used the properties of SVG files to create the map, to add a new room, create a transparent element on the SVG file and give it an ID corresponding to the room number

The project does not include current building floor maps due to time constraints. Contains sample 3 floors.
